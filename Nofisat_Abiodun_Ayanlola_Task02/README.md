# House Price Prediction Project

ðŸ”¹ Project Objective

The goal of this project was to predict house prices based on multiple features such as the number of rooms, size, 
location, and age of the house. The central idea was to apply machine learning regression models and evaluate their 
performance, moving beyond a simple baseline to more advanced techniques.

ðŸ”¹ Models Applied

Linear Regression (Baseline)
A fundamental model assuming a straight-line relationship between features and price.
Served as the benchmark for performance.
Ridge Regression
Introduced L2 regularization to handle multicollinearity and reduce overfitting.
Helped stabilize the model when features were correlated.

Lasso Regression
Applied L1 regularization, which not only combats overfitting but also performs feature selection by shrinking less 
important coefficients to zero.
Enhanced model interpretability.

Random Forest Regressor
A tree-based ensemble model that captured non-linear relationships and feature interactions.
Significantly improved performance compared to linear models, though at the cost of interpretability.

ðŸ”¹ Evaluation Metric
I evaluated the model using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), a robust metric that penalizes large errors more heavily.
Submissions were generated in .csv format for each model (e.g., lasso_submission.csv, ridge_submission.csv, 
RandomForest_submission.csv).

ðŸ”¹ Key Results & Insights
Linear Regression Baseline: I provided a simple but limited predictive power. Good for understanding relationships but 
insufficient for complex data.
Ridge & Lasso: Reduced overfitting compared to the baseline. Lasso was especially valuable for identifying the most 
relevant features, making the model both efficient and interpretable.
Random Forest: Achieved the best performance with the lowest RMSE. It successfully captured complex, non-linear 
relationships in housing prices. However, it was more computationally expensive and less transparent compared to 
regression-based models.

ðŸ”¹ Learning Outcomes
Gained hands-on experience with regression analysis and regularization techniques.
Built, trained, and saved machine learning models into pipelines (.pkl files) for reusability and deployment.
Learned to critically compare models and choose the one most suitable for the dataset.
Developed skills in data preprocessing, handling categorical variables, and generating final predictions for submission.

ðŸ”¹ Conclusion

This project demonstrates the evolution of predictive modeling:
From a simple Linear Regression baseline
To regularized models (Ridge, Lasso) for stability and feature selection
To Random Forest, a powerful ensemble capable of modeling real-world complexity.
It shows that no single model is always the bestâ€”the right choice depends on data characteristics and the trade-off 
between interpretability and accuracy.

Inspirational Closing

Just like building a house requires balance between strength, design, and functionality, building a predictive model 
requires balance between simplicity, interpretability, and performance.

Through this project, Iâ€™ve learned that:
Linear models give us clarity,
Regularization gives us discipline,
And ensembles like Random Forest give us power.

Together, these methods show how data science transforms raw numbers into meaningful, actionable insights.

This isnâ€™t just about predicting house pricesâ€”itâ€™s about learning to predict the future with data.
